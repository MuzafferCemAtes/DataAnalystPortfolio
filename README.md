## Capstone Projects
![dashboard](https://github.com/MuzafferCemAtes/DataAnalystPortfolio/blob/main/British%20Airways%20Review/ss.png)
### [British Airways Reviews](https://github.com/MuzafferCemAtes/DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/main/British%20Airways%20Review)
[Click to see the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muzaffer.cem.ates/viz/BritishAirwaysReviewWCleanData/Dashboard1)

**Description:** This project analyzes and visualizes customer reviews and ratings for British Airways flights, using a structured dataset covering routes, aircraft types, in-flight services, and satisfaction scores. The project begins with data cleaningâ€”loading the dataset, handling missing values, standardizing city names, and separating routes into departure and destination cities. The refined dataset feeds into an interactive Tableau dashboard, where users can explore key metrics such as seat comfort, food, entertainment, and cabin service across various filters like travel class, aircraft type, and traveler type. The dashboard also offers insights into ratings trends over time and comparisons by country and aircraft.

**Technology:**
* Python
* Tableau

**Results:**
* A cleaned, validated dataset, ready for exploratory or advanced analysis.
* Interactive visualizations comparing British Airways flight experiences across regions and aircraft.
* Business recommendation to handle missing data in key fields for better predictive analysis.

### [Google Data Analytics Professioal Certificate Capstone Project](https://github.com/MuzafferCemAtes/DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/main/Cyclistic%20Bike%20Share)
[Click to see the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muzaffer.cem.ates/viz/GoogleProject_17300801176240/Dashboard1)

**Description:** This project, as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, focuses on understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bike-share services differently. The analysis follows Googleâ€™s data analysis process (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act) and is based on a structured dataset covering ride details, bike types, usage patterns, and membership status. Starting with data preparation in PostgreSQL, the dataset was cleaned to remove duplicates, handle nulls, and derive key metrics like ride duration, distance, and trip type (round vs. one-way). The cleaned data was visualized in Tableau, highlighting usage patterns by membership type, time of day, and location, providing actionable insights into how Cyclistic can convert casual riders into annual members.

**Technology**
* PostgreSQL
* Tableau

**Results:**
* A comprehensive and clean dataset ready for analysis, with derived metrics for enhanced insights.
* Interactive visualizations showing key differences in bike usage patterns between casual riders and members.
* Data-backed marketing strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships by targeting casual rider behaviors.

**Description:** This project evaluates and compares the scoring efficiency of top strikers from the Premier League, La Liga, and Bundesliga during the 2022/23 season. Using key performance metrics such as Goals per 90 minutes, Conversion Rate, and Shots on Target Percentage, this analysis identifies the most efficient goal scorers in these elite leagues. The analysis follows Googleâ€™s data analysis process (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act), ensuring a comprehensive approach.

**Technology**
* Python
* Tableau

**Results:**
* Identified Erling Haaland as the most efficient striker of the 2022/23 season across multiple key metrics.
* Provided insights into striker efficiency, highlighting the top 10 performers in Europeâ€™s elite leagues.
* Created dashboards that offer a comprehensive view of scoring efficiency, accuracy, and league difficulty.

### [Books to Scrape](https://github.com/MuzafferCemAtes/DataAnalystPortfolio/tree/main/Books%20to%20Scrape)
[Click to check the website](https://books.toscrape.com/)

Description: This project involves web scraping to analyze and visualize book ratings and prices across different genres from an online bookstore. The analysis focuses on extracting genre-based data, calculating average ratings, and exploring price trends. Using the collected data, it reveals that niche genres like Christian Fiction, Art, and Poetry tend to have higher average ratings, while broader categories such as Psychology and Biography are rated lower. The project concludes that book ratings have minimal impact on pricing, with genre being the primary price determinant.

**Technology**:
* Python (including BeautifulSoup for scraping and Pandas for data processing)
* Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib or Seaborn, if applicable)

**Results**:

* A cleaned and structured dataset with genre, rating, and price information.
* Visualizations demonstrating the average ratings per genre, highlighting highly rated categories.
* Insights into the weak relationship between rating and price, emphasizing genre as a price influencer.

### Data Cleaning Project #1
**Code:**[`BritishAirwaysReview.ipynb`](https://github.com/MuzafferCemAtes/DataAnalystPortfolio/blob/main/DataCleaningProject1/BritishAirwaysReview.ipynb)
**Description:**This project analyzes a dataset containing customer reviews and ratings of British Airways flights. The dataset includes information on routes, aircraft types, in-flight services, and customer satisfaction scores. The project follows a comprehensive data cleaning and preparation process, ensuring that the dataset is well-structured and ready for further analysis. The main steps of this project are: data loading, data cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing city names, splitting routes into departure and destination cities, and preparing the dataset for future analysis such as regression or hypothesis testing.
**Technology**
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* difflib (for string matching)
* geonamescache (for city name validation)
* airportsdata (for handling IATA codes)

Results:
* Cleaned and validated dataset, ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) or advanced analysis like regression.
* Corrected city names and standardized routes by splitting them into departure and destination.
* Business recommendation to handle missing values for regression analysis by excluding or imputing values in key fields like food, entertainment, and wifi.

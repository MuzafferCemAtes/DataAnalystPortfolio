# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and building regression models to predict target variables based on multiple features.

---

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and target variables.
3. **Building the Model**: Implementing and evaluating a Multiple Linear Regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics to assess performance, such as RÂ² and RMSE.

## Dependencies

To run the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Libraries Used:
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced data visualizations.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For building and evaluating regression models.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and classify Twitter posts based on sentiment using a machine learning model. Specifically, the project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether tweets contain positive or negative sentiments. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploration, and model training.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset provided by the instructor as `twitter.csv`. This file contains tweet text and sentiment labels, which we use for sentiment analysis. The dataset has been preprocessed to include only necessary columns, making it ready for machine learning tasks. The dataset file is available in this repository.


## Project Structure
The analysis follows a structured pipeline to achieve sentiment classification:
1. **Data Import and Exploration**: Initial data loading and exploratory analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of punctuation, stopwords, and other noise in the text.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Count vectorization to convert text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.
4. **Model Training**: Training a Naive Bayes classifier on the cleaned data.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
- Basic descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Distribution analysis of tweet length and sentiment classes.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removal of punctuation and stopwords using NLTK to retain essential words.
- Word cloud visualization to highlight frequent terms in the dataset.

### 3. Text Vectorization
- Count Vectorization is applied to tokenize and transform the cleaned text data into numerical features.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Model**: A Naive Bayes classifier was selected for its efficiency with text-based data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion matrix and classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model's performance metrics indicate how well it classifies the sentiment. The evaluation shows potential areas for further optimization, such as testing other algorithms or feature extraction techniques.
